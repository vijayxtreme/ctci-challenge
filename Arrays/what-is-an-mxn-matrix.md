What is an MxN matrix?
----
A matrix is just rows and columns.  
So 2x3 matrix basically means 2 rows, 3 columns.

Before NxN meant same rows and same columns, aka a square (2x2, 3x3).

```python
Remember indices start at 0.
Array of 1x5 (1 row, 5 cols)
arr[0] = 1
[1,2,3,4,5]

Array of 2x2 (2 rows, 2 cols)
arr[0][1] = 2
[[1,2], [3,4]]

Array of 2x3 (2 rows, 3 cols)
printout would look like
arr[1][0] = 4
[
 [1,2,3],
 [4,5,6],
]

Array of 3x3x2 (3 h, 3 w, 3 d) ~ 3D Array
arr[2][1][1] = 16
[
    [
        [1,2],[3,4],[5,6]
    ],
    [
        [7,8],[9,10],[11,12]
    ],
    [
        [13,14],[15,16],[17,18]
    ]
]
```
