What is an MxN matrix?
----
A matrix is just rows and columns.  
So 2x3 matrix basically means 2 rows, 3 columns.

Before NxN meant same rows and same columns, aka a square (2x2, 3x3).

```python
Array of 5x1
arr[5]
[1,2,3,4,5]

Array of 1x2
arr[1][2]
[
    [1,2]
]

Array of 2x3 => arr[2][3]
printout would look like
[
 [1,2,3],
 [4,5,6]
]

Array of 3x2 => arr[3][2]

[
    [1,2],
    [3,4]
    [5,6]
]

Array of 3x3x2 => arr[3][3][2]

[
    [
        [1,2],[3,4],[5,6]
    ],
    [
        [7,8],[9,10],[11,12]
    ],
    [
        [13,13],[15,16],[17,18]
    ]
]
```
